Graph data structure are helpful in some of the following robotics problems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Multi-robot: nodes are robots (most of current work 2022).\\
	There are research on path planning, exploration problems.
	\item Multi-object interactions: nodes are objects, the robot itself \citeaustitle{lin2022efficient}
\end{itemize}

This field is still quite new (2022)
