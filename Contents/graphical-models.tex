\section{Bayesian Network}
Bayesian networks, \ac{aka}, Bayes nets, Belief networks and sometimes Causal networks, are graphical representation of a probabilistic model. It comprises of nodes and directed edges.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Nodes represent variable (continuous or discrete)
	\item Edges represent dependency between variables
\end{itemize}

They are useful in a variety of tasks
\begin{itemize}
	\item Descriptive analytic
	\item Diagnostic analytic
	\item Predictive analytic
	\item Prescriptive analytic
\end{itemize}
